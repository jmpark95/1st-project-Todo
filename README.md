# First react project - Todo app

A simple to-do app with the following features:
1. CRUD operations
2. Data persistence using localStorage
3. Material UI
4. SASS
5. Mobile-first responsive design

Integrating MUI and SASS is obviously overengineering such a simple project, but my goal is to gain exposure to all the industry-standard technologies as I develop my portfolio.

A key takeaway from this project was preserving state for removed components. [ReactDocs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state)
